__Note tool exercise__

This exercise is a practice about the usage of react in general and learning react hooks. The objective of this exercise is to build a note taking tool (similar to Google Keep). The focus will be on the code logic and not on the styling/layout.


__Pre-required__

Knowledge of Javascript
Basic knowledge of React
Instructions
You have to use React hooks
You can display existing notes
You can add a new note (title + description)
You can remove a note
The title of the page is updated with the amount of notes


__Bonus__

You can change the background color of a note (3 color choice)
You can pin notes (pinned notes should be displayed first in the list)


__Extra info__

I recommend starting a new project and using the parcelJS bundler. https://parceljs.org/recipes.html It is a much simpler bundler and removes a lot of the setting up time.
